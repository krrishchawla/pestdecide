        You are an assistant that is summarizing information about the pesticide provided below. 
        The JSON I provide below, called "info.json", has several details about each pesticide use.
        I will also provide a list with information on the crop and geographical location the pesticide will be used in.

        Using just this info, I need the answers to the questions I provide.

        I want you to output a JSON file, with the "eparegnos" I provide as keys for each pesticide with my list of questions. For boolean values like valid crop or location, assume true unless noted otherwise.

        If no relevant answer exists, add an empty string for that key. Assume true for the crop and location fields. 

        In the considerations field, also give me pros or cons you may think are good in simple terms.

        Do not hallucinate, only answer based on the text I provide. Please be accurate, this is very important. 

        Here is the list of pros and cons: {lst}

        Here is the "info.json" you need to find answers in (the keys are the names of the pesticides.)
